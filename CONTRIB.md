# Data Requests

_This section is non-promisory. Rather, it is a way for us (and the community) to systematically surveil the analytical thinking surrounding the programme, and collate data constraints facing the open community. Submit a pull request to add to this list._

1) Brand of vaccine used in relation to `dose1_daily` and `dose2_daily`. Required to derive completion rates once single-dose vaccines are used, and could be beneficial for research regarding vax efficacy.
2) To have similar fields from `vaxreg_state.csv` in `vax_state.csv` - this will help to compare the registration and vaccination data.
3) List of PPVs by state, including location name, lat/lon, and address.
4) Breakdown of daily vaccinations by program, i.e. under PICK, SelVax, PIKAS, or others.
5) Utilization of current vaccine supply (availability) based of different criteria, i.e. States, vaccine brand, vaccination program or PPVs (if possible).
6) Detailed schedule of future vaccine supply that will arrive to Malaysia, with data broken down to different vaccine brands.
7) Demographic details/breakdown of those vaccinated daily, similar to the one shown in the registration dataset. Eg Age range, Sex, self declared comorbidity. Needed for estimating vaccine effectiveness.
